See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.
